# About x-tfl-bus
This is a webcomponent that displays information of London bus stops. It's concept is based in the great work done by Mart√≠ Planellas andhis [TFL tube web component](https://github.com/beldar/tfl-status), but this case uses [x-tags](https://github.com/beldar/tfl-status) as the core technology to build this component.

The number associated for the bus stops is the unique number each stop has, you can find more about this in the [TFL Open Data](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/) web, or simply looking at [urls](http://m.countdown.tfl.gov.uk/stopsNearPostcode/wc2)

```
<x-tfl-bus stopId="76213"></x-tfl-bus>

xBus.refresh();
